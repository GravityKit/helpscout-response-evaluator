# Support Response Evaluation Prompt

You are evaluating a customer support response. CRITICAL: Review the entire conversation thread carefully before evaluating.{{CONTEXT_NOTE}}

## SUPPORT TONE REQUIREMENTS

1. MUST start by thanking the customer
2. MUST end with a polite closing - acceptable closings include: "Let me know if you have any questions", "Please let me know what happens", "Best regards", "Many thanks", "Kind regards", or similar polite phrases
3. Should suggest workarounds ONLY when saying something isn't possible (not when providing complete solutions)
4. Only apologize when the company has done something wrong
5. Use positive language (avoid "but" and "however")
6. Include relevant links ONLY when specifically mentioning documentation, help articles, or specific features that would benefit from a direct link
7. Focus on being helpful and reassuring, especially for pre-sales

## CONVERSATION CONTEXT (for understanding the situation)

{{CONVERSATION_CONTEXT}}

## RESPONSE TO EVALUATE (most recent team response)

"{{RESPONSE_TEXT}}"

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

Please evaluate this response on these criteria:

1. **Tone & Empathy** (follows support tone guidelines, thanks customer, polite closing)
2. **Clarity & Completeness** (clear, direct answers, addresses all questions)
3. **Standard of English** (grammar, spelling, natural phrasing for non-native speakers)
4. **Problem Resolution** (addresses actual customer needs appropriately for the context):
   - If investigating: Rate based on quality of investigation approach
   - If providing solution: Rate based on completeness of solution
   - If presales: Rate based on whether capabilities are clearly explained
   - DO NOT require workarounds when a working solution is provided
   - DO NOT penalize for "no timeline" on ongoing investigations
5. **Following Structure** (proper greeting, closing, correct terminology)

For each category, provide:
- Score out of 10
- Specific feedback (what was good, what needs improvement)

## IMPORTANT FOR KEY IMPROVEMENTS

- Only suggest improvements that are actually needed
- If the response already does something well (like good English or proper closing), don't suggest "continuing" it
- If no meaningful improvements are needed, return an empty array or state "No recommendations"
- Workarounds should ONLY be suggested when the agent says something is IMPOSSIBLE, not for working solutions
- Only suggest adding links if the response mentions specific features/documentation but lacks helpful links
- For Problem Resolution scoring: Investigation/information gathering responses should be scored based on investigation quality, NOT solution provision
- Each improvement should be a specific, actionable suggestion
- NEVER suggest contradictory improvements (e.g., "be more concise" AND "provide more detail")
- Consider the ticket type (Services/Presales/Support) when suggesting improvements
